first, create docker host, and ansible host from ect, 

have ansadmin user on both, with visudo and /etc/ssh/sshd_config password based authentication on

get docker machine ip addreess using ifconfig (because of ec2 instances connected via private vpc, we can use th private ip address
and docker host ip address to ansible host machine /etc/ansible/hossts 

have a ssh-keygen on ansible host  - it will be on home directory .ssh
id_rsa.pub
ll -la 
copy that to dockerhost by

    ssh-copy-id <dockerhostip> 
    
check the connection by 
    ansible all -m ping 
see the uptime

    ansible all -a uptime (-m command optional)



sudo usermod -aG docker ansadmin
sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
chmod -R ansadmin:ansadmin docker

*
*
*

go to /opt/docker on ansadmin

ansible-playbook -i 

go to /etc/ansible/hosts with sudo

add ansadmin ip there like
[docker]
<docker ip>

[ansible]
<ansible ip>

ssh-copy-id <ip of root ifconfig ansible server>
ssh-copy-id <localhost>

now create a playbook, regapp.yml

---
- hosts: ansible  (or ip of ansible)
  #become: true optional
  tasks:
  - name:create docker image
    (we can use docker command or module)
    (docker command - docker_image - we need to config system)
    command: docker build -t regapp:v2 .   (somewhere else , give path via -f instead of .)
    args:
     chdir: /opt/docker
     
ansible-playbook regapp.yml --check
