in the docker host
        cat /etc/passwd                                            
# will list the users
        cat /etc/group                                              
# will get the group
      useradd dockeradmin
      passwd dockeradmin

      id dockeradmin                          

#to check about his group etc
usermod -aG docker dockeradmin
 
 add additional group
 
        vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

find the password using / Password and uncomment password based authentication

        service sshd reload

#optional - we can use ssh keys instead also
          which is ssh-keygen

Go to jenkins and add publish over ssh, we can also use scp if needed
